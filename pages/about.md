## Early Meridian Fire Department History
When Meridian Village was incorporated in 1903, some initial ordinances were established to aid in fire protection. However, the creation of the first volunteer fire fighting unit, which would eventually became the Meridian Fire Department, was not established until 1908. In July of that year a Champion double cylinder chemical fire extinguisher that the Village Board of Trustees ordered arrived from Portland.  On Tuesday July 7th, the fire chief from Boise came to Meridian and trained Meridian volunteers on how to work the machine. The engine itself held two 45 gallon tanks, and was tested during the training by the purposeful lighting of a sage brush fire two blocks from the engine house. It only took 30 seconds for the crew to get there and once they arrived they were able to put out the fire. In excitement, the volunteers that were present that day decided to form a volunteer fire company. LeRoy Adams was designated as the Meridian chief, and 19 men under him became the original village volunteer firefighters. 

## About the Meridian Fire Department Collection
The Meridian Fire Department Collection is produced in cooperation with the Meridian Fire Department (MFD). The Meridian Fire Department allowed the Meridian Library District History Center to access their scrapbooks and other historic materials within their possession. This access allowed the MLD History Center the ability to digitize and preserve the history of the Meridian Fire Department as part of the MLD History Center's larger digital collection of Meridian History. More materials are expected to be added to this collection in future cooperation with the MFD. By no means is this website meant to be a complete history of the MFD, but merely a starting a starting point to preserve the over 100 year history of fire fighting in the Meridian, Idaho area.
