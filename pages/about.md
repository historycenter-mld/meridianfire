## Early Meridian Fire Department History


## About the Meridian Fire Department Collection
The Meridian Fire Department Collection is produced in cooperation with the Meridian Fire Department (MFD). The Meridian Fire Department allowed the Meridian Library District History Center to access their scrapbooks and other historic materials within their possession. This access allowed the MLD History Center the ability to digitize and preserve the history of the Meridian Fire Department as part of the MLD History Center's larger digital collection of Meridian History. More materials are expected to be added to this collection in future cooperation with the MFD. By no means is this website meant to be a complete history of the MFD, but merely a starting a starting point to preserve the over 100 year history of fire fighting in the Meridian, Idaho area.
